## Amazon Shipping Project
This project analyzes shipping data from Amazon to optimize logistics, identify shipping trends, and improve delivery performance. It focuses on analyzing shipment patterns, delivery times, carrier performance, and customer satisfaction through data-driven insights.

### Key Features
- **Shipping Performance Analysis**: Evaluate delivery times, on-time performance, and delays across various shipping carriers.
- **Carrier Comparison**: Analyze the performance of different shipping carriers to identify the most efficient and cost-effective options.
- **Shipping Cost Analysis**: Track shipping costs across regions and carriers to optimize expenses and identify trends over time.
- **Customer Satisfaction Metrics**: Correlate delivery performance with customer feedback, returns, or reviews to assess customer satisfaction.

### Visualization
The project integrates advanced data visualization to present shipping insights clearly:
- **Bar Charts**: Compare carrier performance, such as on-time delivery percentages or average delivery time.
- **Geospatial Maps**: Visualize shipping patterns and delivery performance by region or city.
- **Line Charts**: Display trends in shipping costs, delivery times, and delays over time.
- **Heatmaps**: Show areas with higher shipping delays or performance issues to identify operational bottlenecks.

### Interactive Filters
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Users can filter data by time period, shipping region, carrier, or delivery method to focus on specific insights.
- **Custom Metrics**: Ability to adjust parameters like delivery time thresholds or cost ranges to refine the analysis.
- **Carrier/Region Comparison**: Compare the performance of different carriers or regions dynamically to identify strengths and weaknesses.

### User Interface
The project offers a user-friendly interface with:
- **Dashboards**: Interactive dashboards that present key metrics and allow users to explore the data through filters.
- **Custom Reports**: Users can generate tailored reports based on selected filters and time ranges, which can be exported in various formats (e.g., CSV, PDF).
- **Real-time Updates**: The interface can be designed to update shipping data and analysis in real-time for ongoing operational optimization.

### Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Used for querying and analyzing the shipping dataset.
- **Tableau**: To create interactive dashboards and visualizations, enabling easy exploration of shipping performance metrics.
- **Python**: For data preprocessing, automation of analytics tasks, and integration of more complex metrics or calculations.
- **Database Management Systems**: (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store and manage large volumes of shipping data.
- **Excel/Google Sheets**: For quick data manipulation and reporting, providing a lightweight solution for basic analysis.
